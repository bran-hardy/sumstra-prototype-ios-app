# Sumstra Prototype

This is a prototype for an app called Sumstra. The idea of the app is to track income and expenses I have any give me detailed data on how I am spending money, where I could invest more money into, and other financial aids. (An app for this probably exists, I wanted the challenege of making my own IOS app though)

This app is programmed in ReactNative using the Expo template for my project. Since I don't have a Mac to help me develop, I'm using Expo's virtual machine to load the app on my phone.
